## 1. Parties

 "Author" means ARIYAMA Keiji.

 "You" (or "Your") means the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with Author.
For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor.

For the purposes of this definition, "control" means
 (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or
 (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or
 (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

## 2. Definitions

"Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work,
that is intentionally submitted by You to Author for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by Author (the "Work").

For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Author or its representatives,
including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of,
Author for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

## 3. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Author and to recipients of documents distributed by Author a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to use, copy, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, distribute,
